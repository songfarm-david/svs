Place most basic and fundamental css values in the head of the document -- except keep them in the external script too. They will just overwrite each other.
Also, in your CSS script where you have a position axis property, include what position that axis is referring to.
Use the CSS pre-fixer on your CSS. [prefixr.com](http://www.prefixr.com). Or Google "Autoprefixer". This is runs on CanIUse.com API and is constantly updated. Use this one.
